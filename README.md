Dependencies
------------

Some gems included in Pollinate have native extensions. You should have GCC installed on your
machine before generating an app with Pollinate.

If you're running OS X, we recommend the [GCC OSX installer](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer).

We use [Capybara Webkit](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit) for full-stack Javascript integration testing.
It requires you have QT installed on your machine before running Pollinate.

Instructions for installing QT on most systems are [available here](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/wiki/Installing-QT).

PostgreSQL needs to be installed and running for the `db:create` rake task.
